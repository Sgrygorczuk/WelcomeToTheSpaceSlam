Join the intergalactic sport of basketball, grab and dunk a regular basketball while either dodging or smashing into Fire, Ice, Slime, and Rainbow balls as they are
hurled at you from the skies above. Train on your own or have a friendly local competition in this arcadey space arena. Let the Moon Mates and Sun Strikes battle it out
and the winner be known across the galaxy.
